Left off on populating database and making persistence xml.

You can add classes to persistence file if they are not annotated:

By default, your JPA persistence-unit includes all annotated managed 
classes found in its root. If you want to include any classes that are 
located somewhere else, you can either reference them explicitly or include
all classes from a jar file

Create services that are composed of an _EntityManager_ and has an interface
 for performing CRUD operations for managing _Entities_ with you database.
